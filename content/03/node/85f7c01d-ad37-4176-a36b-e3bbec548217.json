While information can be amazingly on target, there is the possibility of nuanced inaccuracies or true misinformation.<\/p><p>Here\u2019s an example of how AI can miss the mark:<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><h3>Reasons to be cautious of AI<\/h3><p>A ChatGPT query concerning examples of AI applications currently deployed on county and municipal government websites resulted in the following response:&nbsp;<\/p><p><em>\u201cSan Francisco implemented a chatbot on its website to assist residents with common inquiries, report issues, and find information about city services. This chatbot aimed to provide quick and efficient customer support.\u201d<\/em><\/p><p>A review of the website for the City of San Francisco reveals that this is not the case. What was likely being referenced was an entirely separate site, <a href=\"https:\/\/censusgpt.com\/sf\">San Francisco GPT<\/a>. This site, however, is still very much in its beta form, and is not integrated into the official website for the city.&nbsp;<\/p><p>In addition to widely reported inaccuracies, here are six additional reasons to exercise caution before diving too deep or too fast into AI at this point. &nbsp;<\/p><ul><li><strong>Accessibility<\/strong>. AI applications, if not designed and tested with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines in mind, can result in accessibility issues for people with disabilities.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Privacy and Data Security<\/strong>. AI applications often involve collecting and processing user data. Robust systems need to be in place to protect this information. Data breaches or misuse can have serious legal and reputational consequences.<\/li><li><strong>Bias and Fairness<\/strong>. AI models can inherit biases from the data they are trained on. If these biases are not properly addressed, they can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, which is especially problematic for government services.<\/li><li><strong>Transparency and Accountability<\/strong>: Transparency in decision-making is a fundamental principle in government. AI systems can be complex, making it challenging to explain their decisions, which can erode public trust.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Resource Allocation<\/strong>. Developing and maintaining AI applications can be a resource-intensive use of taxpayer dollars. Costs need to be justified.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Vendor Dependence<\/strong>. Many governments rely on third-party vendors to provide AI solutions. As open-source enthusiasts, we at Promet Source vigorously caution against the potential perils of vendor lock-in and data ownership.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul><p>While each of the above six factors are significant, this is not to say that we at Promet are not 100% on board with the possibilities and potential of AI for county and municipal government websites.

While information can be amazingly on target, there is the possibility of nuanced inaccuracies or true misinformation.<\/p><p>Here\u2019s an example of how AI can miss the mark:<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><h3>Reasons to be cautious of AI<\/h3><p>A ChatGPT query concerning examples of AI applications currently deployed on county and municipal government websites resulted in the following response:\u00a0<\/p><p><em>\u201cSan Francisco implemented a chatbot on its website to assist residents with common inquiries, report issues, and find information about city services. This chatbot aimed to provide quick and efficient customer support.\u201d<\/em><\/p><p>A review of the website for the City of San Francisco reveals that this is not the case. What was likely being referenced was an entirely separate site, <a href=\"https:\/\/censusgpt.com\/sf\">San Francisco GPT<\/a>. This site, however, is still very much in its beta form, and is not integrated into the official website for the city.\u00a0<\/p><p>In addition to widely reported inaccuracies, here are six additional reasons to exercise caution before diving too deep or too fast into AI at this point. \u00a0<\/p><ul><li><strong>Accessibility<\/strong>. AI applications, if not designed and tested with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines in mind, can result in accessibility issues for people with disabilities.\u00a0<\/li><li><strong>Privacy and Data Security<\/strong>. AI applications often involve collecting and processing user data. Robust systems need to be in place to protect this information. Data breaches or misuse can have serious legal and reputational consequences.<\/li><li><strong>Bias and Fairness<\/strong>. AI models can inherit biases from the data they are trained on. If these biases are not properly addressed, they can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, which is especially problematic for government services.<\/li><li><strong>Transparency and Accountability<\/strong>: Transparency in decision-making is a fundamental principle in government. AI systems can be complex, making it challenging to explain their decisions, which can erode public trust.\u00a0<\/li><li><strong>Resource Allocation<\/strong>. Developing and maintaining AI applications can be a resource-intensive use of taxpayer dollars. Costs need to be justified.\u00a0<\/li><li><strong>Vendor Dependence<\/strong>. Many governments rely on third-party vendors to provide AI solutions. As open-source enthusiasts, we at Promet Source vigorously caution against the potential perils of vendor lock-in and data ownership.\u00a0<\/li><\/ul><p>While each of the above six factors are significant, this is not to say that we at Promet are not 100% on board with the possibilities and potential of AI for county and municipal government websites.
